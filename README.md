# BreviarySwift
App for reading the Breviary, from iBreviary site

The app gets the recommended liturgic hour for the devices's current hour and shows it.

Liturgic hour's shown language is the device language.

### Notes
I've started this app because I didn't found any that recommends the liturgic hour and is lightweight and with simple user interface.

## Upcoming Features:
- Possibility to select the liturgic hour, independent from current time
- HTML parsing and styling, like the main website
- Possibility to read the day's gospel
- Notifications
- Possibility to download the texts
- Saint/Feast of the day
- Possibility to get texts from other websites (at first, liturgiadashoras.online - Brazil)
